A link to the video walkthrough is in the index.html.

Technologies used:

Node.js
Javascript
npm packages: mysql, inquirer

How to Run

1: bamazonCustomer.js shows all the products by id, name, and price. The customer can then enter the id of the item they wish to purchase and if the amount of the item the customer wishes to purchase is in stock it will execute the order.

2: bamazonManager.js is the manager view. It shows all the products for sale. It allows the manager to view low inventory, items of 5 or less. The manager can add inventory to the stock of an item and the manager can add a new product entirely.
